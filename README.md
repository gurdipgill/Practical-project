# A simple introduction to JavaScript and the DOM

## Clone the lab files with GIT as follows

If you have GIT available, *clone* this repository:

- open the folder where you want to work, *don't* create a new folder for the exercise
- open a command-line terminal to that folder
- type `git clone https://github.com/CTEC3905/03-lab-javascript-1.git`
- check in your folder, you should see a new folder "03-lab-javascript-1"
- move into that folder with `cd 03-lab-javascript-1`
- type `git remote -v` and you will see the URL above, which needs changingâ€¦

## Set up your own repository for these files

First, create *your own repository on GitHub* for these files, then change the GIT remote to the GitHub URL for your new repository with the following commands:

- `git remote set-url origin [YOUR_REPO_URL_HERE]`

then check your remote is your own repository with:

- `git remote -v`

## Key learning points for this exercise

This exercise introduces a few fundamental Javascript principles:

- **immediately-invoked function expressions (IIFE)** (stay out of the global namespace)
- **event listeners** (for capturing user actions)
- **DOM manipulation** (for dynamically changing HTML elements and/or their properties)
